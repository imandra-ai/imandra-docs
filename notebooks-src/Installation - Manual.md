# Manual Installation with opam

If youâ€™re already familiar with the OCaml ecosystem and opam, you can use Imandra as a normal opam package, provided your switch is setup using ocaml 4.12.

The simplest way to install imandra in a custom switch is to install the `imandra-dist` metapackage, which includes the full Imandra distribution:

```sh.copy
opam switch create . ocaml-base-compiler.4.12.1
opam repo add imandra https://github.com/AestheticIntegration/opam-repository.git
opam update
opam depext imandra-dist
opam install imandra-dist
opam exec -- imandra_client -server 'imandra_network_client'
```
