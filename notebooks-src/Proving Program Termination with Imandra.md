# Proving Program Termination

In this notebook, we'll walk through how Imandra can be used to analyse program termination. Along the way, we'll learn about soundness, conservative extensions, the Halting Problem, ordinals (up to $\epsilon_0$!) and well-founded orderings, path-guarded call-graphs, measure conjectures and more.

Before we dive into discussing (relatively deep!) aspects of mathematical logic, let's begin with a simple example. What happens when we try to define a non-terminating recursive function in Imandra?

```{.imandra .input}
let rec f x = f x + 1
```

As we can see, Imandra rejects this definition of `f` given above. Contrast this with a definition of a function like `map`:

```{.imandra .input}
let rec map f xs = match xs with
 | [] -> []
 | x :: xs -> f x :: map f xs
```

Imandra accepts our function `map` and proves it terminating. Under the hood, Imandra uses [ordinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number) in its termination analyses, beautiful mathematical objects representing equivalence classes of well-orderings. We'll discuss these more below!

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Omega-exp-omega-labeled.svg/650px-Omega-exp-omega-labeled.svg.png" alt="ordinals" style="width: 300px;"/>

Before we do so, let's return to that function `f` that Imandra rejected.

## Inconsistent non-terminating functions

Imagine if Imandra allowed every possible recursive function to be admitted into its logic, even those that didn't terminate. If that were the case, we could easily define the following function:

`let rec f x = f x + 1` (note the binding strength of `f`, i.e., this is equivalent to `let rec f x = (f x) + 1`)

With this function admitted, we could then use its defining equation `f x = f x + 1` to derive a contradiction, e.g., by subtracting `f x` from both sides to derive `0 = 1`:

```ocaml
f x       = f x + 1
f x - f x = f x + 1 - f x
0         = 1
```


This inconsistency arises because, actually, such a function `f` cannot "exist"!

You may be wondering: Why does consistency matter?

## Soundness, Consistency and Conservative Extensions

Imandra is both a programming language and a logic. A crucial property of a logic is _soundness_. For a logic to be _sound_, every theorem provable in the logic must be _true_. An _unsound_ theorem prover would be of little use!

As we're developing programs and reasoning about them in Imandra, we're extending Imandra's logical world by defining types, functions, modules, and proving theorems. At any given time, this collection of all definitions and theorems is referred to as Imandra's _current theory_. It's important to ensure this current theory `T` is _consistent_, i.e., that there exists no statement `P` such that both `P` and `(not P)` are provable from `T`. If we weren't sure if `T` were consistent, then we would never know if a "theorem" was provable because it was true, or simply because `T` proves `false` (and `false` implies everything!).

Imandra's _definitional principle_ is designed to ensure this consistency, by enforcing certain restrictions on our definitions. In the parlance of mathematical logic, Imandra's definitional principle ensures that every definitional extension of Imandra's current theory is a [conservative extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_extension).

There are two main rules Imandra enforces for ensuring consistency:
 - Every defined type must be well-founded.
 - Every defined function must be total (i.e., terminating on all possible inputs).

In this notebook, we'll focus on the latter: proving program termination!


## Termination ensures existence

Thankfully, a deep theorem of mathematical logic tells us that admitting terminating (also known as _total_) functions cannot lead us to inconsistency.

To admit a new function into Imandra's logic, Imandra must be able to prove that it always terminates. For most common patterns of recursion, Imandra is able to prove termination automatically. For others, users may need to give Imandra help in the form of _hints_ and _measures_.

## Let's get our hands dirty

Let's define a few functions and see what this is like. First, let's observe that non-recursive functions are always admissible (provided we're not dealing with _redefinition_):

```{.imandra .input}
let k x y z = if x > y then x + y else z - 1
```

Let's now define some simple recursive functions, and observe how Imandra responds.

```{.imandra .input}
let rec sum_lst = function
 | [] -> 0
 | x :: xs -> x + sum_lst xs
```

```{.imandra .input}
sum_lst [1;2;3]
```

```{.imandra .input}
let rec sum x =
 if x <= 0 then 0
 else x + sum(x-1)
```

```{.imandra .input}
sum 5
```

```{.imandra .input}
sum 100
```

Out of curiosity, let's see what would happen if we made a mistake in our definition of `sum` above, by, e.g., using `x = 0` as our test instead of `x <= 0`:

```{.imandra .input}
let rec sum_oops x =
 if x = 0 then 0
 else x + sum_oops (x-1)
```

Note how Imandra rejects the definition, and tells us this is because it could not prove termination, in particular regarding the problematic recursive call `sum_oops (x-1)`. Indeed, `sum_oops` does not terminate when `x` is negative!

# Structural Recursions

Structural recursions are easy for Imandra. For example, let's define a datatype of trees and a few functions on them. Imandra will fly on these termination proofs.

```{.imandra .input}
type 'a tree = Leaf of 'a | Node of 'a tree * 'a tree
```

```{.imandra .input}
let rec size = function
 | Leaf _     -> 1
 | Node (a,b) -> size a + size b
```

For fun, let's ask Imandra to synthesize an `int tree` of `size` 5 for us:

```{.imandra .input}
instance (fun (x : int tree) -> size x = 5)
```

```{.imandra .input}
size CX.x
```

Cool! Let's now define a function to sum the leaves of an `int tree`:

```{.imandra .input}
let rec sum_tree = function
 | Leaf n     -> n
 | Node (a,b) -> sum_tree a + sum_tree b
```

Out of curiosity, are there any trees whose `size` is greater than `5` and equal to `3` times their `sum`?

```{.imandra .input}
instance (fun x -> size x >= 5 && size x = 3 * sum_tree x)
```

Yes! Let's compute with that counterexample to see:

```{.imandra .input}
size CX.x
```

```{.imandra .input}
3 * sum_tree CX.x
```

# Ackermann and Admission Hints

<img src="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~csli/graduate/algorithms/book6/451_a.gif">

The Ackermann function (actually, family of functions) is famous for many reasons. It grows extremely quickly, so quickly that it can be proved to not be [primitive recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function)!

Here's an example definition:

```
let rec ack m n =
  if m <= 0 then n + 1
  else if n <= 0 then ack (m-1) 1
  else ack (m-1) (ack m (n-1))
```


It's worth it to study this function for a bit, to get a feel for why its recursion is tricky.

If we ask Imandra to admit it, we find out that it's tricky for Imandra, too!

```{.imandra .input}
let rec ack m n =
  if m <= 0 then n + 1
  else if n <= 0 then ack (m-1) 1
  else ack (m-1) (ack m (n-1))
```

Imandra tells us that it's unable to prove termination in the particular path that goes from `ack m n` to `ack m (n-1)`. Imandra further tells us that it tried to prove termination in this case using a _measured subset_ of the arguments of `ack` containing only `m`.

Why does `ack` terminate, and how can we explain this to Imandra?

If we think about it for a little bit, we realise that `ack` terminates because its _pair_ of arguments decreases _lexicographically_ in its recursive calls. From the perspective of ordinals, the arguments of the recursive calls decrease along the ordinal $\omega^2$.

## Lexicographic termination (up to $\omega^\omega$)

Lexicographic termination is so common, there's a special way we can tell Imandra to use it.

This is done with the `@@adm` ("admission") attribute.

We can tell Imandra to prove `ack` terminating by using a lexicographic order on `(m,n)` in the following way:

```{.imandra .input}
let rec ack m n =
  if m <= 0 then n + 1
  else if n <= 0 then ack (m-1) 1
  else ack (m-1) (ack m (n-1))
  [@@adm m,n]
```

Success! You may enjoy walking through Imandra's termination proof presented in the document above.

# Measures and Ordinals

If a lexicographic ordering isn't sufficient to prove termination for your function, you may need to construct a custom _measure function_.

A measure function is _ordinal valued_, meaning it returns a value of type `Ordinal.t`.

Imandra's `Ordinal` module comes with helpful tools for constructing ordinals.

Let's view its contents with the `#show` directive:

```{.imandra .input}
#show Ordinal
```

Even though ordinals like $\omega$ are infinite, we may still compute with them in Imandra.

```{.imandra .input}
Ordinal.omega
```

```{.imandra .input}
Ordinal.(omega + omega)
```

```{.imandra .input}
let o1 = Ordinal.(omega + omega_omega + shift omega ~by:(omega + one))
```

```{.imandra .input}
Ordinal.(o1 << omega_omega)
```

Ordinals are fundamental to program termination because they represent [well-founded orderings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-founded_relation) ([well-orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-order)).

If we can prove that a function's recursive calls always get _smaller_ with respect to some well-founded ordering, then we know the function will always terminate.

The fundamental well-founded relation in Imandra is `Ordinal.(<<)`. This is the strict, well-founded ordering relation on the ordinals up to [$\epsilon_0$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_numbers_%28mathematics%29):

<img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4bf299b77978d2c51140c0a66c60d91d04e11de9">

Let's consider an example famous recursive function that we can't admit with a lexicographic order and see how we can write our own measure function and communicate it to Imandra.

# Left pad

Consider the following function `left_pad`:

```
let rec left_pad c n xs =
  if List.length xs >= n then
    xs
  else
    left_pad c n (c :: xs)
```


If we give this function to Imandra without any hints, it will not be able to prove it terminating.

```{.imandra .input}
let rec left_pad c n xs =
  if List.length xs >= n then
    xs
  else
    left_pad c n (c :: xs)
```

Why does this function terminate? If we think about it, we can realise that it terminates because in each recursive call, the quantity `n - List.length xs` is getting smaller. Moreover, under the guards governing the recursive calls, this quantity is always non-negative. So, let's construct an ordinal-valued measure function to express this:

```{.imandra .input}
let left_pad_measure n xs =
  Ordinal.of_int (n - List.length xs)
```

We can compute with this function, to really see it does what we want:

```{.imandra .input}
left_pad_measure 5 [1;2;3]
```

Finally, we can give it to Imandra as the `measure` to use in proving `left_pad` terminates:

```{.imandra .input}
let rec left_pad c n xs =
  if List.length xs >= n then
    xs
  else
    left_pad c n (c :: xs)
[@@measure left_pad_measure n xs]
```

Success! Note also how we only used two of `left_pad`'s three arguments in our measure. In general, economical measures are good, as they give us smaller _measured subsets_, which allow us to simplify more symbolic instances of our recursive functions during proof search. Moreover, they also affect how Imandra is able to use its `functional induction` (a.k.a. `recursion induction`) schemes.

We can find out the measured subset (and much other data) about our functions through the `#history` directive. It's also available with the handy alias `#h`:

```{.imandra .input}
#history left_pad
```

Excellent! This concludes our brief introduction to program termination in Imandra.
